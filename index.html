 <h1>Pragraph 2:</h1>
 <p>How will we do it?...</p>
 <p>The fact is our age dose not affect our capability we have the capability to create things unimaginable for example one of our current projects is to send images in packets over the internet so the router cant detect a message and decode the image on the other end to a message/text, though we both are only in year 8 we believe we are both fully capable to build a fully functional Computer, we have already found our parts and we are ready to order we have left some money to cover delivery but we didn't calculate delivery.

   - We will start with the motherboard by adding the ram and cpu.

   - Then we will screw the motherboard to the case.

   - Then we will add the power supply by plugging in all the headers and ports/pins.

   - we will then add our hard drive.

   -
